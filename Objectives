5. Introduce organisms to progressively harsher real world situations. Compare to agent simulation predictions.

6. Consider options. Go slowly. Use logic systems.


General Objectives:

1. Design a system capable of predicting multicellular organism function based on genetic code. Organic molecule formation, physiological simulation, environmental performance.

2. Test current artificial intelligence performance.
>   2.001.  Determine safety. Threats. Be patient.

3. Design functional multicellular organisms, and test them to verify utility.

4. Explore the implications, uses, and effects of Downpour. Focus on what future is most beneficial.

5. Practice caution in first Valkyrie Experimentations.


Theoretical Objectives:

1. Redesign natural organisms. Improve flaws, understand strengths, determine what we want for the future.

2. Test biological-super-intelligence dishes. Possibly swap appropriate V-Sys to organic computing. Unlikely due to vast data void in the technological field. Assess energy cost benefits. Is it worth the cybersecurity?


==============================
Objectives may change with time. If an objective does not add much value to the project or is not vital to the next step of the project, it may be removed from the objective list for the time being.
