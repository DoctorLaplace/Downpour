# Project-Downpour
This project utilizes a series of algorithms, adversarial agents, and simulation tools to study and generate new multicellular organisms; a user interface allows human guidance to tailor desired results.

The goal is an intelligent agent, capable of outputting genetic data to create the desired organisms. Subsequent goals are focused on application implementation. Focus is human benefit, and studying genetically designed cybernetic compatibility.

Hopefully you and I can build a better future.
